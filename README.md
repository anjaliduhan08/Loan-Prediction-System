# Loan Prediction System

This repository contains the code for a Loan Prediction System developed by Anjali Duhan. 

## Overview

The Loan Prediction System is a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not. The system uses historical loan data to train a classification model, which can then be used to predict the outcome for new loan applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Loan Prediction System, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   
   git clone https://github.com/anjaliduhan08/Loan-Prediction-System.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Open the `anjali/Loan Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the Loan Prediction System is not included in this repository. However, you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset).

Please download the dataset and place it in the `dataset` folder before running the notebook.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the trained model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Contributing
